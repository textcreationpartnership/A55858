            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:33568:3"/>of all ſorts, as well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men as to learned men; as you may read ACTS 4.13. EPH. 3.7, 8, 9. And if there were leſs Art and more Honeſty, it would be better for us all. And as for the Miniſters ſent forth only from men, there are two things that ſpoil them; And the firſt is, the looking after a great benefice; And ſecondly for honor among men: Now the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riches and honor are as thorns which choke the Word, which theſe men have got by Art, and other men as well as they, ſo that they all become unfruitful,

            <head>A WORD Touching the <hi>Author and Nature</hi> Of this TREATISE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not add much to the bulk of this book, though there's occaſion admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto me ſo to do; only three or four things (by way of preface) I judg meet thou ſhouldst be put in mind of, whoever thou art that ſeekeſt after God in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Author, Nature, End,</hi> and <hi>opportuneſs</hi> of it coming forth: As touching the <hi>Author,</hi> a thouſand to one, if thou kneweſt his perſon, thou
<pb facs="tcp:33568:8"/>wouldſt have him in very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, not for the evilneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; for were his adverſaries his judges, they would not be able ſcarce to charge him with thoſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that are common to man, ſuch is his known <hi>innocency, ſweetneſs, meekneſs, faith, ſincerity, love,</hi> God having very plentifully ſhowred down of his grace upon him: But that which would be a ſtumbling block unto thee, is, the <hi>meaneſs, lowneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>obſcureneſs</hi> of his Condition (in respect of writing books, according as man judgeth) who being neither a Prophet, nor a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſon, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Amos,</hi> ſhould thus boldly, and groundedly, ſtand up to the reproof of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Seers</hi> of this Age, and Nation, making it to appear, that the moſt of them ſpeak out of the <hi>viſion</hi> of their own hearts, and ſay, the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> when they have <hi>ſeen</hi> nothing: Will they not ſay he takes too much upon him? But their predeceſſors ſaid ſo of Chriſt, and have charged the ſame offence upon <hi>his</hi> in all ages, especially if they have (as he) publikely appeared to diſcover the blindneſs of the <hi>leaders</hi> and <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33568:8"/>of the people.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of this book, I find three things excelling in it, <hi>plainneſs, homeneſs,</hi> and the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly favor of it;</hi> Firſt, the <hi>plainneſs</hi> of it is ſuch, that I may ſay to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all ſorts, that he of them that runs, may read it; the <hi>viſion of God</hi> in it is made ſo evident, and written (as the Lord bid the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, ſtilo humano</hi>) with a <hi>mans pen,</hi> ſo that in it, as ſome ſay of the Scriptures, for the lowneſs of it, the <hi>Lamb may wade;</hi> and for its depth and glory, the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant may ſwim;</hi> or to make uſe of the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſimile, there's found in it, <hi>milk</hi> for babes, and ſtronger meat for them of <hi>riper</hi> age in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the <hi>homeneſs</hi> of it is no leſs to be obſerved, for we ſhall find ſcarce any man of any opinion whatſoever in theſe times, that is not touched to the <hi>quick,</hi> I mean justly judged and taxed in it, for one miſcarriage or another tending to the ſcandal and reproach of pure <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is ſcarce thought on in theſe times: So that in it as in a glaſs, (a clear and cristal one), the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whether <hi>Popiſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33568:9"/>or <hi>Prelatical, Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> (as we now ſpeak) may at once ſee their deformities together with the way and means, as it were <hi>Betheſdas pool</hi> ſtirred to their hands, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of that <hi>high</hi> and <hi>holy Angel,</hi> the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>(Jeſus our Lord)</hi> that they, yea even <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and thoſe of either party, might ſtep therein, and be made every whit whole and in <hi>joynt</hi> again. Lastly the <hi>ſavor</hi> of it is ſo ſweet and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That, methinks I find it altogether ſuch <hi>ſavory</hi> meat, as the Author ſpeaks of, in the body of his book, which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah</hi> (the Churches type) <hi>cook't,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> brought (in <hi>Eſaus</hi>

<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> beſides this Manna (that which we know not what to make of) before our eyes:</hi> Yet let me tell thee Reader, (for therein I ſhall undertake to <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>propheſie;</hi>) wait but a while, and there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for to refreſh the Nation, but that which their ſoul abhors, this <hi>Manna,</hi> of which they ſay <hi>what is it?</hi> though they have had fleſh in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had <hi>quails</hi> (a bird of the earth) that it comes

            <p>The third thing I propounded was to give a hint of the Authors <hi>end</hi> in framing this holy Conference within himſelf, concerning all ſorts and ſects of men in theſe times; and that I have learn't only, by acquaintance with his perſon and peruſal of his book; by means of both I have collected, and comforted my ſelf with this, that he had in his eye, yea in his heart, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſometimes had in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out that was not only between the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in the which quarrel <hi>Moſes</hi> willingly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf and was the death of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> as every true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſeeks to be, for who was this <hi>Egyptian</hi> a figure of? but the <hi>old man</hi> or the <hi>man of ſin</hi> that transforms himſelf into all ſhapes, and under various pretences diſquiets both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State even till now:</hi> Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> took care to bury him in the <hi>ſand</hi> (when no body was by) into which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his mighty <hi>hoſt</hi> ſank afterwards, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended greatly (as the world is now) at the meekneſs of this meek man <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:33568:23"/>and gave them reſt: and ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that blotteth out thy ſins for mine own ſake:</hi> Now there is nothing of man that can move God, but God for his holy Names ſake moves himſelf: This is the great argument which the Saints of old have made uſe of: as for inſtance, Lord, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> I beſeech thee for thy Name ſake, do not deſtroy this people, but let the power of my Lord be great, that is, let the Name of my Lord be great in ſhewing mercy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.12, 13, 17, 18, 19.

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> is this, [God the Father wil not accept of any thing out of Chriſt his Son, or beſides Chriſt] inſtance in <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> which took fire, but not from the Altar, and ſo offered ſtrange fire; <hi>And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord,</hi> Lev. 10.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, [Chriſt is that golden Cenſer in which the prayers of the Saints are.]


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, [Chriſt as God is that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Altar upon which the prayers of the Saints are offered.]</p>
               <p>Fourthly, [Chriſt is the firſt and the only accepted with God, and hath in himſelf much incenſe; and in him are all the prayers of the Saints acceptable and ſweet before God; and by him alone are all the prayers of the Saints
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33568:26"/>offered up to God as a ſweet ſmelling ſavor:] <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Now it is otherwiſe with a Phariſee or an outſide Chriſtian; for they come to God alone by themſelves,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and bring their prayers, and performances, and good meanings to God without Chriſt, and leave Ieſus Chriſt behind them, and ſo they offer ſtrange fire, as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did: And ſo likewiſe they have no golden cenſer for their prayers, nor ſweet incenſe to offer with their prayers; nor any to offer their prayers upon the golden Altar, but themſelves; for they know not Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe place it is to offer up prayers to God: for he is the only accepted of God: and if they ſeem to know him, yet they wil not give him the preeminence in all things: inſtance in thoſe Iews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. <hi>But as it were by the works of the Law;</hi> that is, partly by Chriſt, and partly by their own works, They would come to God; but to come to God without Ieſus Chriſt, is as if the ſtubble ſhould come to the flaming fire to be agreed:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and to come to God with a half Chriſt, or to be halfes with Chriſt, is plain Popery, for it is to deny
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33568:27"/>Ieſus Chriſt the preeminence in all things, as you may read in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. And thus they fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrive to be ſomething of themſelves, with Chriſt, in all things that they do; and Chriſt not to be all in all things for them; but themſelves, as it were, to do ſomething of themſelves, and ſo their prayers become as vain babling, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. for Chriſt wil be all in all things to a man,

               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Now I ſhal make a compariſon of the Phariſee, and of the outſide Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which I ſhal make good by four places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And the firſt place of Scripture is,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13. concerning the Fig-tree; <hi>And Chriſt ſeeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon, and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves:</hi> Here are three things remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33568:27"/>with relation to a Phariſee or an outſide Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt ſees a Phariſee afar off; he ſees into their hearts; he ſees them proud afar off; he tels them they are as graves ful of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Luk</hi> 11.42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>Secondly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt comes to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and they reject him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.47, 48, 53. <hi>and took counſel together to put Chriſt to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt finds nothing in a Phariſee but leaves, and theſe leaves are not <hi>for the healing of the Nations,</hi> as is ſpoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. But rather a bringing in of judgment, and a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Nation; as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did, by ſeeking themſelves, in eating the forbidden fruit, they brought ſin upon the Nations of the world, and ſo became naked; <hi>and they ſewed fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves together to hide their nakednes,</hi> Gen. 3.7. And this is the Phariſee's way; But I wil ſhew you a more excellent way: The Lord God himſelf made coats of skins for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their nakedneſs; and in his goodneſs ſaid, The ſeed of the woman, meaning Chriſt, ſhould ſpread his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33568:28"/>skirt of love over them and cover their ſpiritual nakedneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. And thus much ſhal ſerve by way of comparing the Phariſee to the Fig-tree, that had leaves but no fruit for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond compariſon that I ſhal make of the Phariſees, is this; They are like to thoſe Soldiers that led Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to crucifie him; and after they had done, then they did ſtrive for his garments, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.16, 24. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees cauſed Chriſt to be put to death: and I beleeve, that there are Phariſees now,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> that, though they cannot reach the perſon of Chriſt, yet they can reach the members of Chriſt, to kil them in their outward comforts, and in their good name, and in reproaching of them: for if they have done ſo to the green tree, what wil they do to the dry tree? and if they have put <hi>Christ</hi> to death, they wil proceed to put <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to death alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. And yet they wil ſtrive for Chriſts gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> I mean, they wil ſtrive for the ordinances of Chriſt, and ſeem to take delight in them, as a man doth in his garments; as you may plainly read in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33568:28"/>58.2. And yet they are like dying men, whoſe garments can neither warm them nor keep life in them: If Jeſus Chriſt be not the life and the heat in all his ordinances,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> though you lap your ſelves about with them, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet you may periſh for want of heat: for it is the Spirit of Chriſt that gives forth heat, and makes men lively: <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the letter profiteth nothing,</hi> Joh. 6.63. Jeſus Chriſt tels the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that they are miſerable and naked: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. No, ſay the Phariſees, for we have the ordinances of God and our duties, and theſe are as garments to cover our nakedneſs. Now this is a ſtrain of ſpirit that doth reſt upon moſt people and Miniſters; as one may hear in theſe expreſſions: Since we have begun theſe morning Exerciſes, ſaith one, God hath given us in 70 victories;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> but mark what the Lord ſaith, theſe victories be but the effects; therefore aſcribe not too much to your prayers, but conſider the cauſe; Not for your ſakes, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor for your prayers, be it known unto you, but for mine holy Names ſake, are theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33568:29"/>victories given unto you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. Yet I wil be ſought unto, ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>O!


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> it is a ſweet thing to pray, when the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt teacheth and helpeth us to pray; then we ſhal ſet the Crown of praiſe upon the head of Chriſt alone; for the Spirit it ſelf help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us ſo to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. But it is a bad thing to ſet the crown of praiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of our prayers and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. O that we could do our duties out of love to Chriſt alone! and then take our hearts and our hands off from them, and have our eyes fixed upon Chriſt alone, and not upon our duties: for why ſhould we be like the [Hen] that when ſhe hath done her duty, ſhe tels all about her:

                  </label> The Phariſee ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be much for the praiſe of God, yet hath but little or no acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Give God the praiſe,</hi> ſaith the Phariſee to the blind man that was cured, and <hi>as for this [Follow]</hi> meaning Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>we know not from whence he is,</hi> Joh. 9.24, 29. A Phariſee doth not really know Jeſus Chriſt; therefore he doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally complement with Chriſt Ieſus:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33568:29"/>
                  <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> ſaith the Phariſee, <hi>what ſhal I do that I may get heaven?</hi> Why, ſaith Chriſt, thou knoweſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and yet thou canſt not ſpel my Name in them;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> therefore thou art miſerable, poor and naked: No, ſaith the Phariſee, I am not ſo; for I have obſerved all thoſe Commands that thou didſt bid me, from my youth to this day: Wel, ſaith Chriſt, I ſee into thy heart, and that is not right to me, for all that thou haſt done, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. And this web, ſaith Chriſt, which thou doſt truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſhal be as a ſpiders web, and ſhal not cover thy nakedneſs; and this ſtaff, which thou doſt lean upon, ſhal be as the ſpiders houſe; <hi>But it ſhal not ſtand; though thou ſhalt hold it fast, it ſhal not endure,</hi> Job 8.13, 14, 15. Though a Phariſee ſeem to come to Chriſt; yet at the ſame time he doth thruſt Jeſus Chriſt away from him.</p>
               <p>Now the third compariſon,


<label type="milestone">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> that not to be of the Phariſees ſimple judgment, one ſhal have no place amongſt them, no not ſo much as to be the Beadle of a Ward: not to be one in their way, is as much as to be put out of their Synagogue: as for inſtance in the blind man, <hi>And they caſt him out,</hi> Iohn 9.32, 33, 34. And ſo you may inſtance in <hi>Lazarus: But the Chief Priests conſulted, that they might put Lazarus alſo to death:</hi> For he was a cauſe that the people went to meet Ieſus Chriſt, as you may read in the Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 12.

Have not we many chief Prieſts and Phariſees now in our days, as wel as there were in Chriſts time, that ſit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult againſt their brethren? as you may ſee in <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 11.

               <p>Secondly, It is for Exhortation to you, Mr <hi>Edwards;</hi> beware of being like to the Scribes and Phariſees,
<note place="margin">Mar. 12.38</note> which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33568:32"/>neither loved Chriſt nor his followers. Miſtake me not, I am no favorer of Sectaries; yet I can, with patience, look upon them til God doth change their hearts.</p>

               <p>And in the fourth place, Beware of being like unto the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, in loving to be chief, and to have the uppermoſt places, and to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and beware that you be not like the Phariſees and Lawyers, that lode men with burdens grievous to be born; and for a pretence make long prayers, and ſo devour widows houſes; that is, you oppreſs the weak and poor, by your power and ſelf-ſeeking: Read, if you pleaſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.38, 39, 40. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.44, 45, 46. Maſter <hi>[Edwards]</hi> be not angry with me for quoting theſe Scriptures unto you; for they are the words of our Savior to the Phariſees and to the Lawyers; and they were as wiſe men as your ſelf [Mr <hi>Edwards</hi>] and as zealous; read <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. and yet they made no conſcience in ſeeking to kil Jeſus

[and ſo the chief Prieſts and Phariſees likewiſe were very skilful in clothing Jeſus Chriſt with a filthy garment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and then they made the people out of love with him;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and then <hi>Barabbas</hi> muſt be let looſe, and Chriſt muſt go to ſuffer:] As for inſtance in their reproaching of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, They thought Chriſt was come <hi>to destroy the Law,</hi> Mat. 5.17.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, They ſaid Chriſt was a Blaſphemer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.3, 4.</p>
               <p>The third is this, They ſaid Jeſus Chriſt was a gluttonous man, &amp; a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, and did reſort to ungodly men, and to ſinners, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.33, 34.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:33568:33"/>
               <p>In the fourth place, They ſaid that Chriſt was a Conjuror; <hi>This fellow,</hi> ſay they, <hi>doth caſt out devils by Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub the prince of devils,</hi> Mat. 12.24.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, They accounted Jeſus Chriſt to be a breaker of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and a looſe fellow; for which they did perſecute him, and ſought to kil him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.16.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.30</p>
               <p>In the ſixth place, They thought Chriſt would give liberty to ſin; and this they ſaid, tempting him; <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Law, commanded us that this woman ſhould be ſtoned for the act of adultery, but what ſayſt thou? And thus the ſubtil Phariſees ſought where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might have ſomething to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Jeſus Chriſt of, [as Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> doth his members;] <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh place, The chief Prieſts and the Phariſees took counſel againſt Jeſus, and ſaid, <hi>What do we?</hi> For this man with his new doctrine and his new light, wil draw all men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and then we ſhal loſe our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.47, 48.</p>
               <p>In the eighth place, the Phariſees conſulted among themſelves againſt Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Perceive ye how ye
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33568:34"/>prevail nothing, [Behold, the world is gone after him]</hi> he wil increaſe, and we ſhal come to nothing, if we let him alone, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.19.</p>

               <p>In the ninth place, Here you may ſee the baſe eſteem that moſt in the world have againſt Jeſus Chriſt, though they ſeem to profeſs Religion: [it appears in this] that they hate thoſe which Chriſt loves;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> not directly as thoſe that Chriſt loves, but under ſome notion, as the Phariſees perſecuted Chriſt, not as Chriſt; but under ſome notion; as a Conqueror, or as a Blaſphemer and a looſe Fellow, and a Sectary, or one that did draw the world after him; [and ſo the world doth not hate men, as members of Chriſt,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> but under ſome notion, as Independent, Antinomian, Separate, Sectary, or a Troubler of the State: and ſo they wil do them all the hurt they can, though they ſpeak them fair to their face:] now the ground of all this hatred is, They hate Jeſus Chriſt firſt,] as Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>If the world hate you, [ye
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33568:34"/>know that it hated me before it hated you]</hi> Joh. 15.18, 19, 20. Now Maſter <hi>Edwards,</hi> if you wil come in, and give your vote, with the High Prieſt, and Phariſees, and people, againſt Chriſt, come in; but that I ſuppoſe you wil not do: But the Phariſees had incenſed the people againſt Chriſt; And they all cry out to <hi>Pilate, If he were not a Malefactor, we would not have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up unto thee,</hi> Joh. 18.30, 31. Here you may ſee the reproaches and mockings which Chriſt did bear. Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> I would deſire you to take notice of the ſpiteful behavior of the [Chief Prieſts] and the people, whom the Chief Prieſts [had moved to cal for <hi>Barrabas,</hi> a murderer, to be let looſe, and Chriſt, our Savior, to be crucified] <hi>For Pilate knew that the chief Prieſts had delivered him to be crucified for envy,</hi> read <hi>Mark</hi> 15.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. And <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold your King: But they cryed out, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him: Pilate ſaith unto them, Shal I crucifie your King? The chief Prieſts anſwered, he is none of our King;</hi> and thus you may ſee their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33568:35"/>blindneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14, &amp;c. Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> I ſhal crave leave to ask you one queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is this, What is the reaſon that the chief Prieſts, and the Phariſees, and Lawyers were ſo blind concerning Ieſus Chriſt? They had the Scriptures of the Prophets, &amp; they did teſtifie plainly of Chriſt; as Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39, 46, 47. But they had but the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word; and to deal plainly, Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A queſtion.</note> I think you have no more: They had the letter of the Word, but they had not the life and ſpirit of the Word: therefore they could not ſee Ieſus Chriſt, though he was amongſt them; nor love him, becauſe they had not the love of God in them. M. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> Is not this your caſe? You have the letter of the Scriptures, and you ſay that you are a Miniſter of Chriſt; and by this rule the Ieſuits and Friers, and the learned Doctors of <hi>Rome,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> and the Pope, and all the falſe Prophets in the world, are Miniſters of Chriſt; but theſe run, and the Lord hath not ſent them: [M. <hi>Edwards</hi>] I ask the queſtion: Have not you done ſo? Conſider what God ſaith, <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>yet they ran: I have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33568:35"/>not ſpoken to them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>yet they propheſied:</hi> read <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.21.</p>
               <p>Beware of falſe Prophets,

And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you do, as thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.17, 18, 19, 20. If they cannot walk by your dark light, then you cry out of this new doctrine and this new light: The chief Prieſts and the Phariſees mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the people to envy againſt Chriſt: Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> do not you move the people to envy the members of Jeſus Chriſt?

And are not you, M. <hi>Edwards,</hi> like unto thoſe in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that cryed out againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt?

And in your tenth head, you charge them, under the name of Sectaries, with hypocriſie, under pretences of piety and holineſs, <hi>pag.</hi> 61. [M. <hi>Edwards</hi>] do not theſe ten heads, which you have layd down to accuſe your brethren, though falſly, come forth from you, like unto thoſe ten horns which came out of the ſeven heads, and <hi>theſe ſeven heads are ſeven mountains;</hi> and this is the myſtery of the woman, and of the beaſt that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: Read <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 25. The Lord teach us to know this myſtery and a falſe Prophet; for

Now in the next place, M. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Are not your ten Heads, which you have produced in your 61. page, like unto the horns which the Prophet <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> ſpeaks of; and wil you puſh the Church with theſe horns, and ſcatter <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah?</hi> Here you may ſee a power that did ſcatter <hi>Iſrael:</hi> or here you may ſee a mountain of power that wil ſcatter <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But <hi>who art thou, O great mountain? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Zerubbabel,</hi> that is, before Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>thou ſhalt become a plain,</hi> Zech. 4.7.

And ſo likewiſe in the next place; Miniſters ſent out only from men, may be able externally to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and to work miracles, as thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do that are ſent out from God; as for inſtance, the wiſe men of Egypt did caſt down their rods, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſerpents, in like manner as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod did; but <hi>Aarons</hi> rod had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.10, 11, 12.

                  </label> Yes, for the doctrine of Chriſt is ſpiritual, though it may be delivered literally, or in the letter, and ſo it may be as a Cabinet ſealed up to him that carries it or delivers it:

               <p>The ſecond is, Chriſt and God is in every true Beleever: <hi>I in them, and thou in me,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>The third is, Every true beleeving man and woman were in Chriſt before the world was; and as ſoon as they came into the world, they went aſtray,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and then were accepted again in the beloved, that is, in Chriſt; they have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of all their ſins, at once, and not by peece-meal: and this is to the glory of free grace.

               <p>Secondly, The man in Chriſt is the moſt able of all men for to try the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that men bring, whether they be of God or no: for a man in Chriſt is bleſſed with ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt; and he tries the doctrines of men, whether there be any ſpirituality in them or no;

               <p>Thirdly, A true Beleever in Chriſt is able to declare the truth to others, and that out of experience; Come, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I wil tel you what God hath done for my ſoul, or in my ſoul, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 66.16. Here you may ſee the

Now for the abilities of the Saints there are degrees, ſome more able to try the doctrines of men, and ſome leſs able; and ſo ſome are more able to declare the truths of God to others, and ſome are leſs able, as it pleaſeth God to beſtow his gifts to men.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon or ground, why, or how they come to be thus able?</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> It may be to more profit then thoſe that are called their Teachers; and at this the world is angry; and ſays, that boys and girles, now adays, are become wiſer then their Teachers: It pleaſed God to inſtruct <hi>Timothy</hi> from a child to know the holy Scriptures, and to know the mind of God in Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. when the old zealous <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s know but little of God, and nothing of Chriſt, though they have the holy Scriptures before them: read <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. But out of the mouth of babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings God doth perfect his praiſe: and they, for the moſt part, ſpeak ſo, as though they had, by experience, taſted of the ſweetneſs of the grace of God in Chriſt: read <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 8.2.</p>
               <p>Now by theſe few lines you may take notice, That none but thoſe that know the voyce of Chriſt, whether young or old, are able to try the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of thoſe that ſay they are the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All thoſe that are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, have a divine right and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33568:44"/>to try the doctrines of men.</p>
               <p>The Church hath liberty from God to try their Officers before they truſt them: [<hi>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.21.]</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Beleeve not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they are of God; becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world,</hi> 1 John Chap. 4. Verſ. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Church ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh their Paſtor and their Officers; for the ſhepherd may err, as wel as the ſheep may go aſtray: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle to the Church of the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi> Bid <hi>Archippus</hi> take heed to his miniſtry, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33568:45"/>even to put them out from amongſt them, if they walk diſorderly, as ſome in our days have done; <hi>When ye are come together,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among your ſelves that wicked perſon:</hi> and if that wicked perſon, then by the ſame power, the Church may put away from among them either Miniſter or Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, if they walk contrary to ſound doctrine; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 12, 13.

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> and are not we in the ſame condition now in our days? Have not we them that plead for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right?


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/>[And time was that theſe men, or the moſt of them, were the Biſhops ſervants in obſervations, and now I think they wil be our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.] But let me, which am the leaſt among all the ſons of men, adviſe a little with you, and let us conſider wel what is Divine Right, and how far it doth extend, and whether it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Clergy alone, and not to the people; or whether it doth belong to the people, as wel as the Clergy; and whether the people, in particular Congregations or Pariſhes, have not power to cal to account either Miniſter or Church-Officer that walks contrary to ſound doctrine, and depoſe them and put them out of their places, if need ſo require, with the advice of moderate men; I mean thoſe honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33568:46"/>Commiſſioners, who could have no place among our rigid Clergy.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> Let me, I pray you, once more give you advice; when you truly know what Divine Right is, then yeeld ſubjection unto it: nay, I know you that fear God, it is your delight ſo to do: and as for your Miniſters and Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, they ought to be in ſubjection to the Church; for the Miniſter and the Church-Officers are not [the Church,] but members of the Church, and the Church cals them to be Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and gives them power to officiate in their places: Therefore they that cal are greater then they that are called: I ſpeak of an outward cal; and this is the Churches Divine Right, and no no particular mans right. Apply your ſelves to the Church, ſaith our Savior, and if he neglect to hear the Church, the Church hath power over him, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. And ſo likewiſe, if you have any that would be great over all, let him be ſervant unto all, ſaith our Savior, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.35. The Church of Chriſt knows the voyce of Chriſt, and the mind of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are able to diſcern the inward
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33568:47"/>indowments of a Miniſter. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this Kingdom take al upon truſt, and cry out, O! he is a brave ſcholer, he is a great learned man;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and ſo they ſwallow down all, without any diſlike at all Now you that are the freemen of Chriſt, endeavor to know the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that Chriſt hath purchaſed, even with an unvaluable price; and <hi>be not the ſervants of men; for ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23.</p>
               <p>I ſhal now ſet forth three paths: and thoſe that walk in them. I think they are not like unto the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: There is much talk, now adays,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in publick, of thoſe that creep into houſes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and lead captive ſilly women: [But I think never any crept more into houſes, then thoſe that would have had two ſhillings and nine pence in the pound: and ſo likewiſe thoſe that labor, in the firſt place to make ſure their tithes unto themſelves, which both City and Country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of: I ask the queſtion: Do not theſe creep into houſes, and lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſilly men as wel as women?] Miſtake me not; it is fit that thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33568:47"/>that be Miniſters of the Goſpel indeed, ſhould have means to live on; that they and theirs may live comfortably in this world, yet the people ought to be free, and not conſtrained.</p>
               <p>The ſecond path is this, He that ſoweth diſcord among brethren,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his way is an abomination to the Lord,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/>
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.16, 19. I ask the queſtion: Do not many of our Miniſters walk in this way? O, it would be a ſweet thing, if our Miniſters were men of peace! and would labor to make peace among the people; but I think they are unfit men, becauſe they cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, many of them.</p>
               <p>The third path is this:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thoſe that bind heavy burthens, and lay them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens conſciences; ſuch men are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of a Chriſtians joy and faith, for a man ought to be perſwaded in his own heart; <hi>For whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.5, 23. And ſuch Miniſters as compel mens conſciences, are not like the true Miniſters of the Goſpel: For <hi>Paul</hi> proved himſelf to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, in theſe words, [<hi>We were gentle among you, even as a nurſe cheriſheth her children;</hi> and ye are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33568:48"/>dear unto us as our own ſouls, and this is the language of the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7, 8. And as for us, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we have not dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye ſtand;</hi> read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p>We have an old Proverb amongſt us,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label>
                  <hi>The burnt child fears the fire:</hi> We are newly come out from Prelacy, and from the High Commiſſion Court of bondage, which was at <hi>Lambeth</hi> houſe, where the Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> did ſit and impoſe an Oath upon mens conſciences; and if they did ſcruple at it, then he did ſend them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reverend Divine, as he ſaid, who did live in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr Gouge.</note> Dr <hi>Gouge</hi> by name; and he ſaid, he would reſolve them of the lawfulneſs of it; and if they could not be reſolved by him, then they were ſent to priſon,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> except they would take that helliſh Oath to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves: But I hope it wil not be ſo now; yet this man is one that would ſit at the ſtern of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: But I hope he and the reſt of our Learned, wil not ſtrive for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence or domination, as <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33568:48"/>did over the Church of Chriſt, read 3 <hi>John</hi> 9, 10. I deſire likewiſe that there may be no fierceneſs of ſpirit in our Miniſtry or Miniſters, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by force, or to compel by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo put a yoke upon the people of God, <hi>which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear;</hi> and thus the Apoſtle complains of a ſect of Phariſees, that would have commanded the Church, by force, in his time, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5, 10. [And ſo likewiſe the chief Prieſts and the Phariſees cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> that there might be ſome ſpeedy courſe and ſtrict way conſidered of againſt him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, for they were Sectaries,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and would draw the people after them, and ſpoil their Kingdom;] and then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would come and take away both their place and nation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.47, 48. Now if thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be the Miniſters of the Goſpel, deſire to be great either over mens perſons, or over mens conſciences, let them wel conſider theſe two or three places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: Our Savior cals his Diſciples, and tels them, <hi>The Kings of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33568:49"/>the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over one another; and they that are great in authority are called Benefactors:</hi> And thus the Diſciples, though they were with Chriſt, had fooliſh thoughts about greatneſs; but, ſaith Chriſt, it ſhal not be ſo amongſt you, for ye are brethren, and I have given you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that ye ſhould go before one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in holineſs and meekneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>But he that wil be greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve,</hi> Luke 22.24, 25, 26. John 13.14, 15. Mark 10.42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place of Scripture is that in <hi>Peter,</hi> where the Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Elders of the Church, or the Miniſters of the Church, to feed the flock of God gently, and not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; neither to be as lords over Gods heritage, or lordly againſt them, but to be as enſamples to the flock in all humility and love, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhal deſire,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> with all humility and tenderneſs of affection, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon, both to Miniſters and to the people; Live in peace one with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33568:49"/>another, and have fervent love among your ſelves; the which you ſhal be able to do when God doth ſhed his love abroad in your hearts; and theſe alone wil heal our diviſions, and put an end to our ſtrife; and this wil be ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when our eyes are opened: For which conſider theſe three places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, how good and how pleaſant it is, when brethren dwel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity: It is like the precious ointment:</hi> It is like the ſmel of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant field, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 133.1, 2.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place of Scripture is that of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe faith wrought by love; for <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Lot, Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen,</hi> [<hi>for we be brethren,</hi> Gen. 13.8.] Now thoſe that would have ſome ſpeedy courſe taken againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſo put them to grief,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> are not like unto faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they are like <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> and in this they are like the Phariſees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:33568:50"/>
               <p>The third place of Scripture is this, concerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was a type of Chriſt: <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave gifts to all his brethren, but to <hi>Benjamin</hi> he gave double: God gave large gifts unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that was the ground why his brethren hated him, and called him dreamer, as you may read, and ſo they fought to ſlay him: Take heed ye ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> do not think evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Benjamin:</hi> but if there be any amongſt you that is like unto <hi>Reuben,</hi> hearken to him: for <hi>Reuben</hi> would have preſerved <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> from the rage of his brethren, but he could not; yet conſider once more, <hi>Joſeph</hi> hath his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt hath his <hi>Benjamins,</hi> and loves them, and hath ingraven them upon the palms of his hands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15, 16. Take heed, ye ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> what ye do againſt your brethren: and be not like unto the world, which cry out for ſome ſpeedy courſe to be taken for the ſuppreſſing of their brethren; but it is under the name of Sectaries: and ſo they cry out, that they may be declared againſt, and then they may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to proceed againſt them for: But
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33568:50"/>I wil tel you what I think; that many of thoſe that are ſo far out of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are as <hi>Benjamin</hi> when his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacob</hi> named him, ſons of the right hand; <hi>Benjamins</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt loves,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and wil rejoyce over them to do them good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40, 41. Now you that think you do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when you put your brethren to grief, and ſpeak harſhly againſt them, becauſe they are not of the ſame mind with you: Conſider what <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and now ye wil take Benjamin away:</hi> [I cannot bear this:] <hi>all theſe things are againſt me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> unto his ſons. The irons have entred into <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſides in the Prelates time, and <hi>Simeon</hi> was bound up in priſon, and wil you now take <hi>Benjamin</hi> from me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.36. and ſend him into a far Country, or elſe put him to grief at home? Conſider <hi>Lot,</hi> he being in <hi>Sodom,</hi> it could not be deſtroyed for his ſake, whileſt he was there: And ſo likewiſe conſider whether your zeal be according to knowledg, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. And conſider <hi>Pauls</hi> being in the ſhip; all the mens lives were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33568:51"/>preſerved for his ſake, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.22, 23, 24. Theſe be great myſteries, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. But I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and his Church; Chriſt loves his Redeemed ones, one as wel as another, and the world is bleſſed for their ſakes: But I am ſorry to ſee them that do profeſs themſelves to be knowing men, and yet know not ſo much as <hi>Laban</hi> did concerning <hi>Jacob;</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/>[<hi>Laban</hi> ſaid, he had learned by experience that the Lord had bleſſed him for <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſake:] And <hi>Laban</hi> did intreat <hi>Iacob</hi> to abide with him and his family, and he ſhould have contentment and reſpect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. But now ye ſons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> you are worſe then <hi>Laban,</hi> for you evilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat your brethren and ſpeak harſhly of them; and the Kingdom is too little to hold you both; nay, ſay ſome, the Kingdom muſt be rid of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things can be wel; and is this the way to make all things wel? Wil this pleaſe <hi>Iacob?</hi> nay, wil not this diſpleaſe Jeſus Chriſt, to ſee brethren of one profeſſion, in a Kingdom, in a Family, to bite at one another, to ſtrike at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33568:51"/>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE"/> and the one laboring to thruſt the other out of the Kingdom, or elſe ſhut him up in a pinfold at home, and make all men to diſlike him, and to ſpeak evil of him, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſons did of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, Now we have no infallible men, as the Prophets and the Apoſtles were, therefore we ſhould do as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did, ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſee whether thoſe men, that preach, preach according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or no, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.10, 11.</p>

               <p>But it wil be counted a boldneſs in a man that dwels in a Pariſh to try the Miniſter or the Church-Officers; but the Church may cal them to account: I mean, the whole Pariſh, or a ſelect Congregation may cal their Officers to account, for they are but as Stewards

Now in this caſe, amongſt them, the Officers would not caſt out the Officers; but they all conſpired againſt the people to keep them in bondage:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and if they did but ſtir, then they had them up into their Courts, and they were very chargeable: But I hope it wil not be ſo now. We uſe to ſay there are two things that make a Miniſter, a Cal of God, and a Cal of men: and if the Cal of men be able to inſtate them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place, then that power that puts them into place, is able to put them out of place again: I mean, the whole Congregation have power, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to put out of place either Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Church-Officer, if need ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But to prevent the charges of our new Courts, let us conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is it ſo, that there is not a wiſe man amongst you?</hi> if

And if this gift of diſcerning be wanting, then, it may be, we ſhal take an enemy into our boſom, and caſt out our friends, and then both the Miniſters and Church-Officers wil be at a loſs among themſelves. Now the Lord help us out of this way: and for the moſt part of the people in a pariſh, they have a vail before their eyes: [and how few in a pariſh are there that can make out a right knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt! how unable then are ſuch people to chuſe Church-Officers!] It may be they wil chuſe ignorant men inſtead of knowing men, and blind men inſtead of ſeeing men: And then it wil come to paſs, as our Savior ſaid, <hi>If the blind lead the blind, it is very likely they may both fal into a ditch,</hi> Mat. 15.14.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay,

               <p>I anſwer: The clear ſpiritual and Evangelical preaching of the Goſpel: <hi>For unto this wil all the Nations flow:

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> I Shall now crave leave to commend two or three words to the Elders.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is this,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Word. </seg>1</label>
                  <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, that you be made skilful; for your skil, if it be right, doth extend to all the flock of God: Therefore ſuch men muſt be taught of God, or elſe they will never be good guides, nor skilful watchmen; for theſe gifts muſt be ſingular in ſuch men, and far above ordinary gifts: And ſo likewiſe, ſuch men muſt be full of the holy Ghoſt; and the holy Ghoſt muſt make them overſeers, and inable them, or elſe they cannot break the bread of Life, nor open the Fountain of living Water to hungry and thirſty ſouls, which gape for the ſweet conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that flow forth from Jeſus Chriſt, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood. It is to be feared, many of our preaching Elders are not ſo inabled, as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33568:62"/>to preach out of their own experience, but ſpeak other mens words, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver other mens judgments; and if it be ſo with our preaching Elders, it is likely to be ſo with our lay Elders: and if ſo, then the Church is like to be poor, and will be like a ſtarved childe with a bad nurſe. <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>to your ſelves,</hi> and ſee that you make known the good will of God, as I have done, <hi>to all the flock of God,</hi> and that by the power of the holy Ghoſt, and feed them with the food of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>The ſecond word that I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Elders, is this,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Word. </seg>2</label>
                  <hi>Let the elders that rule well,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>be counted worthy of double honor,</hi> if they rule according to the Goſpel, eſpecially they who are made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the labor of love, in the word and doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Theſe be preaching Elders that are here ſpoken of, which are able in ſome meaſure to teach the people; for the Elders ought to be able to teach the people, and that for three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It hath been the cuſtom of the Church, to ſend their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33568:63"/>preaching Elders abroad to gather in ſouls into the Church, and to ſtrengthen them that are gathered in [and the Church ſent forth <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he ſhould go as far as <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Elders were to teach the people, and to inſtruct them in his abſence.] Read <hi>Act.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. &amp; 15.2, 3, 4, 22.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is this:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Elders together with the whole Church, ought to be able to vindicate the doctrine of the Goſpel, and to keep it pure, in caſe their preaching Elder ſhould corrupt it. Speak to <hi>Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the Church of <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and bid him <hi>take heed to the miniſtery,</hi> and look that he ſpeak no more but what he hath <hi>received from the Lord,</hi> and fulfil that with love and diligence. Read <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.16, 17.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is this.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>[The Church of Chriſt is a Fountain of Gardens, or Plants in an Orchard, that bringeth forth pleaſant fruits.] <hi>Can.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14. The Church of Jeſus Chriſt is like unto a pleaſant Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe Schollars are believing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe School-maſter is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20, 21. And theſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33568:63"/>Schollars are all taught of God. <hi>I will inſtruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou ſhalt go,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>and I will guide thee with mine eye, Pſal.</hi> 32.8. And again, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, Iſai.</hi> 48.17. Now for this Reaſon, the Elders which are but as ſtewards to the Church, ought to be able to teach the people, of the manifold grace of God, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. Put the caſe, the preaching Elder ſhould die; then you may take, if you pleaſe, the Apoſtles advice; Look ye out among your ſelves a man full of the holy Ghoſt, and wiſdom, and chuſe ſuch a man. Read <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, 5, 6, 7, 8. This is the Apoſtles advice; for the Church of Chriſt in its young age, had many men in it that were ful of the holy Ghoſt, and of heavenly wiſdom: and I hope the Church now, in its old age, hath many more that are made able to teach others. If we do not ſet up a form for Religion, and deny, through ignorance, the power of Religion, and ſo take the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, which we ſhall do, if we reſt upon thoſe that ſeem to teach others that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33568:64"/>which they have not learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the third,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Word. </seg>3</label> is this: The Elders which are among you, ſays the Apoſtle, I exhort, who alſo am an Elder, [feed the flock of God.] Now the flock of God is full of hungry and thirſty ſouls, and nothing in heaven or earth can ſatisfie them, but onely Jeſus Chriſt. I have found him whom my ſoul loveth, ſays the poor ſoul that was ſick with love to Chriſt, <hi>Can.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. Now the poor ſoul having found Jeſus Chriſt, ſits down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte, ſays the thirſty ſoul, <hi>Can.</hi> 2.3. Now the Elders


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> that are not able to feed the flock of God, are uſeleſs in their place; but the Elders that God doth ſend, are able to feed the flock of God; and therefore they are of excellent uſe in their place. Now the Elders that are not able to teach the flock of God;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to do that which is ſomething like unto the Phariſees; for they bound an outward profeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon mens ſhoulders; as the making
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33568:64"/>clean the outſide of the cup and platter, and the waſhing of hands; and in the mean time, theſe ignorant Phariſees omited the weightier matters of the Law, as Judgment, Mercy, Faith, and Love; for Love which comes forth from true Faith, I think there is but very little of it in uſe now in our days; if there be, What meaneth neighbors vaunting, in pride,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> againſt their neighbors? what meaneth thoſe proud ſcornful looks, that one neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor hath againſt another? if they be not of their mind, and dance not after their pipe,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/>[one ſide of a ſtreet will not hold them, if they happen to meet.] And this is a ſad thing to ſee: and yet we tithe Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin, and ſuch like things as theſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.4, 5, 6, 7, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. And ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. And we ſeem to take content in outward obſervations, and ſay, O! the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord are theſe: and yet we know not the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh, <hi>Jere.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2, 6, 7, 8. And thus we outwardly appear before men, but inwardly we
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33568:65"/>are ignorant of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, [as it will appear in moſt Pariſh Churches: for one ſaith, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ever ſince he could remember; and another, ſhe ſaith, ſhe hath as good a heart as the beſt; and another, he hopes to be ſaved for his good meaning, and for his good thoughts; and another ſaith, he believes as the Church believes; and another ſaith, he believes what the Preacher ſaith; and whether it be true or falſe, he cannot tell, but God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but he ſhould believe his Miniſter.] Now ſuch people are ſoon drawn to a form of Religion of any faſhion; for as the State changes, ſo they wil change. Now there are ſome others that can talk learnedly, &amp; they think they know much; but indeed and in truth, they underſtand but little of Jeſus Chriſt: yet they may have a curious form of Religion,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and a gloſſie form of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious words, which they may get by a cuſtomary way of Religion; and by the abilities of nature, and by reading in good Books, as in a Catechiſm, and the like; and ſo they may ſpeak the words that other men hath labored for, and learn them; and ſo much a Parrot
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33568:65"/>may do, and doth do. Miſtake me not, I ſpeak not againſt the uſing of good Books, for I know thoſe that are lame muſt have a crurch. But one word with underſtanding and grace, is better then a thouſand words in a Catechiſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> we may be like to the Jews, in ſeeming to take delight in approaching to God upon our Faſting days, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58.2. If we do that which is like unto the Jews, then we are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews: and if we do not faſt unto the Lord, then we do faſt unto our ſelves; but if we do faſt unto the Lord, then what meaneth this bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſheep, ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul;</hi> what meaneth, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> this putting forth of the finger, and ſpeaking againſt our neighbors and brethren; what meaneth this ſtrife and debate, and this biting and devouring one another, and this ſmitting with the fiſt in private? Is not this wickedneſs, to bow down our heads as a bull-ruſh, and yet theſe things remain, and we ſeemingly call upon the Lord. But this is not to faſt unto the Lord. Read <hi>Zech.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:33568:66"/>7.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. [Now if it would pleaſe God to help us but to keep one right Faſting day, then we ſhould looſe the bands of wickedneſs, and undo the heavy burdens,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and let the oppreſſed go free, and break every yoke, and deal our bread to the hungry, and cover the naked, and ſhew mercy and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every man to his brother. Then this would be a faſt unto the Lord, and a feaſt unto men.] Read <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.6, 7. Now the Elders that are not able to feed the flock of God, they outwardly appear to be religious before men, as Chriſt ſpeaketh; ſo you may read <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27, 28. And ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and ſo ſaith the Lord, <hi>They make my people erre,</hi> they ſeem to be that which they are not, <hi>that bite with their teeth and cry, Peace: and he that putteth not into their mouths,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> they even prepare war againſt him.</hi> Have not we had many ſuch Prophets and Elders in our days? read <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5, 6. And ſo likewiſe the Lord takes notice of the people, as well as of the Prophets and the Prieſts. <hi>The Prophets prophecy falſly,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33568:66"/>Prieſts bear rule by their means; and this is a horrible thing committed in the land;</hi> and my people, ſaith the Lord, <hi>love to have it ſo:</hi> Mark this O ye people of <hi>England,</hi> for the Lord takes notice of you that call truth error, and error truth, <hi>Jere.</hi> 5.30, 31. Now the Elders that are not able to feed the flock of God; <hi>and the prieſts that teach for hire, and the heads of the houſe of Jacob that abhor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or neglect to do juſtice to the poor, and ſo pervert all equity;</hi> yet ſaith the Prophet, <hi>they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, none evil can come upon us.</hi> My deſire is, that theſe things were not to be found amongſt us at this day, read <hi>Micah</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.3, 4. Mark what the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, <hi>They lean upon the Lord;</hi> that is, they lean upon the ordinances of the Lord in a carnal way; they lean upon being outwardly baptized, and the hearing of the Word preached, and the outward receiving of the Sacrament; and they lean upon Church-fellowſhip, and upon an outward Confeſſion of Faith, onely in words. But mark now what
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33568:67"/>our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>The fleſh profiteeh nothing:</hi> miſtake me not [I ſay to lean upon the outſide of the ordinances of God, <hi>profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> which the moſt part of the world doth to this day.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> and with fire; that will teach you, and help you to profit, and that will refine you, and thorowly purge your hearts, and gather you as good wheat into Chriſt garner, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16, 17. And ſo to lean upon the outward preaching of the Word, that will not profit us, until Chriſt open our ears and ſpeak in our hearts, and ſay, this is the way, and I will inable you to walk in this my way, and you ſhall ſpiritually hear this voice; and I will wait, ſaith the Lord, to be gracious unto you, and I will turn a pure language unto you, and you ſhall ſerve the Lord with one conſent, read <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35.5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.18, 19, 21. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33568:67"/>to lean upon the outward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, <hi>it will profit nothing.</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> A blinde man thats bid to a feaſt, though he cannot ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the feaſt, yet he may taſt of the goodneſs and ſweetneſs of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: but in this caſe of coming to the Sacrament it is otherwiſe; for a man may ſee carnally, but he cannot taſt ſpiritually; but he that cannot taſt ſpiritually of the Lords banquet, he cannot ſee ſpiritually; and ſo he ſits naked, not having faith to ſee the want of Chriſts righteouſneſs; and ſo he ſits naked before the King and the Saints: Now Chriſt is the King of this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; and a man not having faith is <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> when Chriſt ſpeaks unto him, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Now a Saint and a true Beleever are in a better condition,

And Chriſt promiſes, That he wil never leave the poor ſoul, nor forſake it in its greateſt wants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> for to ſend his love-token into their hearts; that is, the ſweet Spirit of God, for to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in the hour of temptation, and to comfort them in their greateſt diſtreſs, and to teach them to have communion and fellowſhip with God, and with Jeſus Chriſt; and this is the food that a true beleeving ſoul feeds upon, in all the ordinances of God, and in all the promiſes and providences of God in this world; and this is that which a Saint leans upon, even upon the very boſome of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, as that beloved Diſciple did lean upon the breſt of Chriſt at Supper, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.20.</p>

<label type="milestone">

                  </label> It is not a vain repeating of ſin, as the Phariſee and the Heathen do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7. and as moſt people do; but it is a forſaking of ſin, as the man in Chriſt does, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. It is not a bare confeſsion of ſin in words, but it is a turning from ſin to God: [and this is the work of Chriſt onely,] and none of thine O man. <hi>Turn me, O Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ephraim, for I cannot turn

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> like people;</hi> and ſo on the other ſide, as a State changes or alters in matters of Religion, ſo the people will change and alter in matters of Religion: but a State or a Councel of thoſe men that are called Divines, are not to fit at the ſtern, as the ſteer-man doth; for to compel by force, or to force men in matters of Religion, contrary to that which he knows himſelf; and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a man doth that out of fear, which afterwards becomes ſin: <hi>For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. Therefore we ought to wait till God doth perſwade the heart of a man; for a man ought to be perſwaded in his own minde, that he may do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. So in the next place, let us look to him, whoſe place it is to ſit at the ſtern, and that is Jeſus Chriſt. Now there is none that will preſume to ſit in that place with Jeſus Chriſt, but onely one, and that is Antichriſt; and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33568:84"/>he with his, do exalt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Chriſt, who is God, as you may plainly ſee, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4, 7, 8, 9, 10. And this myſtery of iniquity is diſcovered in theſe latter times, by the Spirit of Chriſts mouth, and with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> Now Chriſt in the heart of a man, is the onely and the alone ſteers-man; he guides the ſoul in matters of Religion; he teaches the ſoul the pure Religion, which is to have faith in God, and to fear, and to love God, and to have hope, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God; and he teaches the ſoul to know, that he hath preſented it to God, without ſin, or ſpot of ſin, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, and that it ſhall ſtand without blame forever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in love; and Chriſt in the ſoul, doth help the ſoul in this preſent wicked world, for to fly from ſin, as from a ſerpent; and Chriſt by his Spirit doth lead forth the ſoul for to rejoyce in God, and to ſee God rejoycing over it, for to do it good, <hi>Iere.</hi> 32.40, 41. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. And ſo likewiſe, Chriſt leads forth the ſoul actively to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate in all lawful demands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 5. And ſo likewiſe, Chriſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33568:84"/>doth help the ſoul paſſively to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Magiſtrate in all unlawful demands; that is, to ſuffer, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that which they command you: as for inſtance, <hi>Be it known unto thee, O King,</hi> ſay thoſe three Worthies, <hi>we wil not ſerve thy gods, though thou caſt us into the burning fiery furnace,</hi> Dan. 3.18, 19, 20. And thoſe that Chriſt doth thus inable, can pray, and do pray for the Magiſtrate; therefore let them live peaceably by you, in your Cities and Pariſhes, and do not diſdain them and force them to ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in another caſe, and now we ſhal have no more place in theſe parts, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live in, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.23.</p>

               <p>In the ſecond place, Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> he ſits jeering, in his <hi>Gangraena,</hi> of one Mr <hi>Spencer,</hi> a new up-ſtart preacher, who was formerly a Coachman, as he

And a true Chriſtian he doth proceed and come forth from Jeſus Chriſt, as the branches do from the vine, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. And as Jeſus Chriſt told <hi>Philip</hi> the words that he ſpake, and the works
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33568:99"/>that he did, it was not he that ſpake the words, and did the works, but it was his Father, that dwelleth in him, that did ſpeak the words, and do the works, <hi>John</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. And ſo a true believing Chriſtian, he ſaith, it is not he that doth, but it is the ſtrength of Chriſt that doth inable him for to do all that he doth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. And the life that he lives, it is not he, but Chriſt that lives in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. And thus Chriſt is formed in a Chriſtian,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> and a Chriſtian is formed in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They with fained words make merchandiſe of men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. And with cunning craftineſs,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and a ſleight, they lie in wait to deceive, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. And thus they creep into houſes, nay, into mens purſes, nay, into the houſe of mens judgments and affections;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> and theſe are they that creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly men, that are as weak as ſilly women: theſe ſilly women that are here ſpoken of, are unſufficient in nature for to diſcern the things of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. Miſtake me not, I do not mean thoſe that preach now in houſes; for this was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles practiſe, Read <hi>Acts</hi> 5.42. But there are others that creep into houſes, witneſs the whole Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> a miniſtery, but not of Chriſt; and theſe are they that lead captive whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Cities, and the people muſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33568:100"/>not ſay, what do you; <hi>and if they put not into their mouths, they will prepare war againſt them, and though theſe crafty ones cry peace, yet they will bite with their teeth, Micah</hi> 3.5. And ſo they become <hi>like unto wolves in ſheeps clothing, Matth.</hi> 7.15. But I hope it will not be ſo amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whereby you may know the falſe prophets from the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, if you have ears to hear, is this, You may know them by their preaching; for they preach but according to the notions of the brain, onely by nature and by art, and ſo ſpoil men with vain philoſophy and deceit, which is not after Chriſt the head; and ſo they beguile men with a voluntary humility of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they know not what, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.8, 18, 22, 23. And ſo they, and thoſe that they teach, are both natural and carnal: Now the natural man perceiveth not the things of God, but after a fooliſh manner, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.14. And a carnal preacher and hearer, are both of them at enmity with God and Chriſt, and with the members of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.2, 3. But I hope we ſhall
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33568:100"/>have none ſuch amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The third thing that diſcovers the falſe prophets from the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, is this,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If you have an eye to ſee what light they ſee by,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> it is no new Light, for they jeer at that; but the light that they ſee by, is as old as old <hi>Adam,</hi> onely natural as the heathen Philoſophers were, and they were great Scholars. Now theſe pretending pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and preachers, <hi>That run when the Lord doth not ſend them, and yet they ſay, he ſaith, Though they ſteal the word they ſpeak from their neighbor,</hi> read <hi>Iere.</hi> 23.21, 30, 31. Now the light that theſe falſe prophets and preachers walk by, it is the light of nature, and the light of the nation, and the light of morality; and they have a word to ſpeak for Chriſt, and they have a word to ſpeak againſt Jeſus Chriſt when time ſhall ſerve; and they are moſt converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in outward external obſervations for Chriſt, and none more forward, then they, for to perſecute, or betray Chriſt and his members, when time doth ſerve. Inſtance in <hi>Iudas, Iohn</hi> 18.2. <hi>Then they came with their lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns, and their torch-lights, for to ſeek
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33568:101"/>for Ieſus, and Iudas was in the midſt of them, Iohn</hi> 18.3. Now it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of falſe prophets and preachers, for to be grievous wolviſh to the flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> And though the prophets and prieſts be bad for the moſt part, and ſpeak falſhood in the room of truth; yet there is a ſort of people to be found in all ages anſwerable to theſe falſe prophets, that will receive error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of truth; nay, <hi>they love to have it ſo,</hi> read <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.31. Who would think that there were ſuch prophets and people in the world! it is to be feared,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> that there are ſuch prophets and people, even now amongſt us.</p>

Now the great buſineſs that makes all to be Chriſtians, as we think, and all in Pariſhes ſtrive after, is this; Some will have their children to be baptized, though it be with the ſigne of the Croſs, and Godfathers for to witneſs it, becauſe it is the old way; and ſome will have their children for to be baptized to make them Chriſtian ſouls; and this is the reaſon that they give:

               <p>The condition of moſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is ſuch, That if they hear the Word preached, and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they think this is enough for to Chriſtianize them, though they be but as Heathenized; for Chriſt hath no room with them, but in the ſtable, or in the High Prieſts hall; yet cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will go to the Church, and do as their neighbors do.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the laſt act of

<note place="margin">Our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Religion explained for the moſt part.</note> They will have their dead buried like unto Chriſtians, that is to ſay, As the reading Prieſt hath uſed to ſay, <hi>Thou haſt taken to thy ſelf the ſoul of our dear brother, here departed:</hi> This they would ſay, Though he lived and died a blaſphemer of God, and an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt, and hath a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then amongſt men, and yet he will call him a Chriſtian brother, and ſo commit his body to the earth, ſaying, <hi>Earth to earth, aſhes to aſhes, in ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope of reſurrection.</hi> And thus with Maſs and Mattins, and ſaying Prayers over the dead, we make up our outſide Chriſtianity. And this is the common profeſſion of the moſt of our Proteſtants in all Pariſhes. Miſtake me not, I do not ſay all, in all Pariſhes; neither conceive of me, as though I did ſlight the Ordinances of God, or any decent way that is of good report, or praiſe-worthy: But I ſpeak of the formality, and groſs ignorance that is amongſt us,

                  <p>Now thoſe that are uſually called by the name of Independents, whether they be Miniſters or other men, they are not Independents: and this is their vindication which <hi>David</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy Word have I hid in mine heart; that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> Pſa. 119.11. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus, Chriſt had lodged himſelf in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and Chriſt was a lamp of ſpiritual light in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and this light did ſhine in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, as a bright candle in a clear lanthorn, to guide <hi>Davids</hi> earthly feet; and this light did ſhine, as the Sun at noon day, in <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul, and was his light to guide him in his heavenly path-way, which way is Chriſt: <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path,</hi> Pſa. 119.105. John 14.6.</p>
                  <p>Thus much by way of vindication of thoſe which are called by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful name of Independents, which wil live under no Government, as they ſay. But here I have ſhewed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33568:118"/>you what ſpiritual Government they live under, and what light they walk by and depend upon, it is even the Light and Government of Chriſt, which the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, thoſe Independents, &amp; the others which were afore-named, would not live under, nor endure them that did: Witneſs <hi>Cain,</hi> who <hi>ſlew his brother,</hi> Gen. 4.8. And witneſs the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, which <hi>conſulted that they might put Lazarus to death alſo: Becauſe that by reaſon of him, many of the Jews went away from them, and beleeved on Jeſus,</hi> John 12.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>And thus much ſhal ſerve for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Dependency, which thoſe have in Chriſt and upon Chriſt, which are falſly ſo called by the name of Independents. Now this internal part of wiſdom is a myſtery, which none of the Princes of this world know, none of your great learned Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, chief Prieſts and Phariſees know: <hi>For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33568:123"/>this man was brought upon the ſtage for an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Burges</hi> at <hi>Lawrence</hi> Church, did diſpute learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly againſt him (but to little purpoſe) as one that would take up the weapons of a dead man, to fight with him when he was dead.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond man is young Maſter <hi>Simpſon,</hi> a man unblameable in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and a man eminent in the work of the Lord, but counted an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and ſo looked upon as contemptible.</p>
                  <p>The third man is Maſter <hi>Peter Sterry;</hi> ſuch a man, as there are but a few in reſpect of the great number that are called the Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> yet this man lyes under two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful names, as <hi>Antinomian</hi> or <hi>Familiſt,</hi> or elſe jeered at by ſome, for a Free-grace Preacher. This <hi>Peter Sterry</hi> is a man approved to be an Evangelical, Heavenly, Divine Preacher of the Myſtery of the everlaſting Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now, no miniſtery but ſuch a miniſtery, can be a ſoul-comforting miniſtery, becauſe it is full of Light and Life, Peace and Joy in the holy Ghoſt;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33568:124"/>But no new light, as ſome cry out; but an old light of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. which was before the foundations of the earth were laid, read <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Now the fourth man is one like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr <hi>Stirrey,</hi> and that is Mr <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh,</hi> a man eminent to declare the King in his beauty, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the roſe of Sharon, and the lilly of the valleys;</hi> And as an apple tree among the trees of the wood, is excellent, even ſo is Chriſt among his ſons and Chriſt is the pearl in the field; and as a ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land and all this Chriſt is to them that know him; and ſuch can tel how to ſpeak to his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>The fifth man, that I ſhal ſpeak of, is, Mr <hi>Bacon,</hi> a man of worth, if ſome amongſt us had ears to hear and eyes to ſee: But there are ſome, nay many, both in <hi>London</hi> and in the Country, to whom he is approved, both in their hearts and conſciences, to be an able Miniſter of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and one that is Evangelical and ſpiritual; and one
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33568:124"/>that is made able, by the Spirit of Chriſt, to give a good Expoſition of the holy Word of God, which is a ſtrengthening of the feeble knees, and the hands that hang down, and this is his glory and joy, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> read 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. And this is his crown, let him go where he wil.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome that are like the blind man, as you may read in <hi>Mark</hi> 8.24. that are half-ſighted men, and they encountred him, and cal him bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and a ſetter forth of ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or new doctrine, that they do not know, and it is ſtrange unto them; and this was <hi>Pauls</hi> condition, read <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18, 19, 20.

                  <p>But ſome do object and ſay, that he is ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue, and ſo was <hi>Moſes; Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue,</hi> Exod. 4.10. But if <hi>Moſes</hi> his Lord be with his mouth, and the Lords Chriſt teach him what he ſhal

                  <p>I deſire that I may not be accuſed of ſeeking the applauſe of theſe men that I have ſpoken of: for the praiſe of men to me, is as a feather upon my ſleeve, which the wind will blow away; but I have had thoughts of their worth, and not of theirs onely, and ſo I reſt.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They live not as they liſt, but as the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus doth conſtrain them; and ſo in its love it doth direct them, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We are to do nothing for Chriſt, as the moſt people in the world do to this day; for this were to go down to Egypt, the fleſh, for ſtrength to get Chriſt: but this wil be to no purpoſe, or vain labor. [Now in this caſe, <hi>Our ſtrength is to ſit ſtil,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.7.] Chriſt is <hi>a gift of God,</hi> John 4.10. and not for us to get of God or from God. We are not to work for life, but we are to work from a principle of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus: A right knowledg of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33568:133"/>this; and the exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, and the in-comes, and the in-dwelling of the Divine Nature in our nature and in our hearts: Now this is the ſeed in the tree of life,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> which wil cauſe us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/>
                     <hi>The loftineſs and the haughtineſs of men ſhal be made low: and the Lord alone ſhal be exalted in that day,</hi> read and compare 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.17, 20, 21, 22. together. Now when the grace of God in Chriſt doth abound in your hearts, ſaith the Apoſtle, That <hi>wil make you that ye ſhal neither be barren nor unfruitful in the works of the Lord, nor in the knowledg of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> read 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. Now this wil ſtop the mouths of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, that ſay that you ſay, Chriſt hath done all for you, and you need to do nothing: Now I know you wil anſwer and ſay, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Philip,</hi> The words that you ſpeak,
<note place="margin">The Saints defence.</note> and the works that you do, it is not you that do them, but it is Chriſt, who is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33568:134"/>God, that dwelleth in you, that doth all in you and for you; and by the ſtrength of Chriſt you do what you do; and Chriſt ſhal have all the praiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> You are accuſed of ſaying, That you need not pray for the pardon of ſin:
<note place="margin">Of the pardon of Sin.</note> Now the Love of God, and the Blood of Jeſus are the pardon of ſin, and the pardon for ſin: and the ſweet Spirit of God is the Meſſenger that brings the Manifeſtations of this pardon unto the ſoul, nay into the ſoul, and makes it glad: In my love <hi>I have bloted out thy ſins as a thick cloud,</hi> ſaith the Lord.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.22</note> And with my Sons blood I have writen a pardon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22, 28. Now this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don lies in the Covenant, ordered in all things, and made everlaſtingly ſure, though I do not as yet beleeve it, or at ſometimes I do not ſo clearly ſee it, or feel it in my ſoul; Read and conſider 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Now in time of Trouble,
<note place="margin">The time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> or in time of Ignorance, when men do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; or in time of Deſertion, when God doth withdraw himſelf, or hide
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33568:134"/>his face; or in the time of men being weak in faith, then they are apt to think that there is no pardon, or that there muſt be one got made for them; but there is one ready for them before they pray for it or cal for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. Now the love of God, and the blood of this man, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, meaning Chriſt, who offered one ſacrifice for ſins, from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. Now this is the pardon that is ever ready for poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to come unto, and <hi>it is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt,</hi> Hebrews 7.24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Now we are not ſo much to ask for the pardon, for that is ſure and ſtedfaſt in the heaven of God; but we are to ask much more for the manifeſtations of this pardon in our own ſouls, and that by the Spirit of God; and this wil make <hi>the lame man leap as an Hart,</hi> Iſa. 35.5,
<note place="margin">How the ſoul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</note> 6, 7. and make the ſick man wel, and heal all our doubts, and expel our fears, and make us holy and heavenly before God; as for inſtance, ſaith <hi>Ieremiah, The Comforter that ſhould relieve my ſoul, is far from me,</hi> Lam. 1.16. And
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33568:135"/>ſo in <hi>David,</hi> Lord, ſaith he, I know my pardon is ſure,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> but there is a cloud before me and it; Lord, ſaith he, take this cloud away,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Davids</hi> prayer Pſ. 51. opened.</note> and cauſe me to hear the joy and gladneſs that I had wont to have in and with the Spirit of Chriſt.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> O Lord, reſtore this joy, and let me have thy free Spirit to comfort me and uphold me. O Lord, let thy holy Spirit be conſtantly in my breſt, or in my heart, <hi>that the bones which thou haſt broken, may rejoyce.</hi> The abſence of thy Spirit, O God, is as the breaking of bones: and the preſence of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, O God, is as marrow and fatneſs, and as wine upon the lees: And thus it was in <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 51.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And thus it was between the Church, and the Spirit of Chriſt, in her union and communion with the Spirit of Chriſt; I am thine, and thou art mine, ſaith the ſoul to Chriſt: <hi>I am my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> And this we know, ſaith the Apoſtle, by the Spirit of God, which he hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given unto us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Now the queſtion is not, whether there be a pardon or not a pardon; but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33568:135"/>whether I, ſaith a poor ſoul, have any intereſt in this pardon, or no,
<note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of a poor ſoul want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> I know not. And if I had, ſaith a poor ſoul; or if I could but get, ſaith another poor ſoul, the aſſurance of the pardon of my ſins, then I ſhould tread the world under my feet. I know, ſaith another poor ſoul, that there is a pardon, but whether it be for me or no, it is not as yet revealed unto me; but if it were revealed in my ſoul, then it would be as a crown of life to me: as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt crowned me with loving kindneſs, and with tender mercies,</hi> Pſa. 103.4, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Now the word <hi>Pardon,</hi> which is ſo much ſpoke of amongſt us, and prayed for by us,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> it is apparently known to be, and to be generally held forth unto all men, for Chriſt hath ſpread as large a plaiſter as <hi>Adam</hi> made the ſore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>And life, and death, good and evil, bleſſing and curſing, are ſet before men: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuſe life,</hi> O men! <hi>for why wil ye dye, O ye ſons of men?</hi> Deut. 30.13, 14, 15, 19. Ezek. 18.31.</p>
                  <p>Now you wil ſay,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> I am for general Redemption, and for free wil.</p>

<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionmade and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> I am for that which God is for; <hi>It is not in faln man to direct his ſteps to God,</hi> Jer. 10.23. All men in <hi>Adam</hi> went out of the way from God and are to be found in a way of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, 12, 18. <hi>Can the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots?</hi> No, it is their nature: we have a proverb, That cuſtom is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond nature: Man, at the firſt, falling into ſin, ſin is become a cuſtom, and ſo is become a ſecond nature; and ſo men drink in ſin, as a fiſh drinks in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, no more can a man change himſelf, that is accuſtomed to ſin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23. A man, in his ſins, is dead to true living actions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 4, 5. Now God, in his time of love, came the ſecond time to man,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> and ſaid unto him,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/>
                     <hi>Live;</hi> and this was a more high and excellent life then that which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 7, 8. Now a man, in and by nature, may give credit unto God: and thus the Heathen Philoſophers did: And ſo men may naturally give credit to the Scriptures; and thus the moſt men do, and no more.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> But now to beleeve E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33568:136"/>That the moſt high God came down, and became Chriſt,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> and was manifeſt in our fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. and was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, and was found in faſhion as a man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. And he was our pardon and our ranſom to free us from ſin, and from hel &amp; the grave; and hath raiſed us up together with himſelf, that we may be where he is, and that is in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. Now if you would find God, you muſt look for him in Chriſt:

                  <p>Now if you ask,
<note place="margin">Where the Church is.</note> where you may find the Church; you may find the Church and God both together in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19. Now this is a great myſtery, to know <hi>Emmanuel,

Now faln man hath not free wil to beleeve this great myſtery: he may hear the report of it, but he cannot ſee it; <hi>For fleſh and blood hath it not to reveal unto him,</hi> Mat. 16.16, 17.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> But the man that is raiſed up in Chriſt, the new man, he ſees and beleeves this great myſtery,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> 2.8, 9. Now free wil, in faln man, is, to do evil continually: every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and thought of his heart is evil; nay, the very purpoſes, and his deſires every day are evil: and thus the earth is corrupt before God, and all earthly men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.11, 12, 13. read the whole Chapter. <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord,</hi> as the Sun in the Firmament is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> that it needs not doubt of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; for he hath put an end to its ſins, and brought in everlaſting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto it, for to cover it; and he will open its eyes and awaken it, that it may run and read its pardon, and be ſatisfied with beholding his face in righteouſneſs, which will transform it into his likeneſs, and cauſe it for <hi>to ſing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33568:144"/>the ſong of the Lamb,</hi> and to have <hi>the high praiſes of God in its mouth, Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Chriſt tells the ſoul, that God ſees no ſin in his,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> that is, in [the new man,]


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> that is, the heavenly man, which is that holy thing which ſhall be <hi>born</hi> in thee, O thou poor ſoul; and this <hi>holy thing</hi> ſhall be formed in thee, O thou poor ſoul: and this is [the <hi>ſeed</hi> of God] which ſhall [be <hi>born</hi> in thy heart] <hi>[and it cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.]</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> And this is the good part, or the better part, which Chriſt ſpeaks of to <hi>Martha.</hi> [Now this good thing,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> or this better part, is even God himſelf.] Now we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, betwixt the ſpirit and the fleſh. Now in the Spirit, which is of God, there is no evil or ſin;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> but in the fleſh, there is not this good, neither can <hi>fleſh and blood inherit the Kingdom of God: for in my fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, I know there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Now a true Chriſtian in this life, doth conſiſt of good and evill. Now the good part in a true believing man or woman,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> brings the bad part every moment unto the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:33568:144"/>Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be crucified, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>By which Croſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am crucified to the world, the fleſh, and ſin;</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> are <hi>crucified unto me,</hi> upon this Croſs. <hi>And I thank God, through Chriſt my Lord, which hath freed me from the body of this death; So that with the minde,</hi> I my ſelf, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſerve the Law of God; but in my fleſh, there is a law of ſin,</hi> which is nailing to the Croſs of Chriſt every day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48, 49.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.41, 42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.19. Theſe Scriptures ſhew where God ſees no ſin.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> And theſe Scriptures which I ſhall now name, ſhew how and where God doth ſee ſin; that is, in the fleſh, and upon the Croſs of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.50. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Free-grace doth not open a door to let in ſin into the ſoul; but the ſoul as a chaſte Virgin, married unto Chriſt, the Fountain of Free-grace; by which grace, the ſoul is ſtrong to ſhut the door againſt ſin, <hi>Romans</hi> chap.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33568:145"/>verſe 4. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. verſes 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Thoſe that ſpeak ſo much of Free-grace, are not infectious as a plague [as ſome call them] and ſay, they are corrupt in the brain, and ſo they are dangerous. Now ſuch men do labor to bring an <hi>evil report</hi> upon theſe men, for Free-grace ſake. Now by this means, there is a diſaffecting, and a great neglecting of the ſpeaking of Free-grace, and rather a teaching of men for to do ſome good thing of their own,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> as it were, and ſo to get our ſelves qualifications, as it were, for to fit us for Chriſt. <hi>Good maſter what ſhall I do,</hi> ſaith the young man, <hi>that I may inherit eternal life? Mark</hi> 10.17. And ſo ſaith the Phariſee, <hi>I have faſted and prayed, and done many things;</hi> therefore, <hi>I am not as other men are, Luke</hi> 18.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Now is it not apparent, that moſt people and Miniſters,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> do fall in with theſe two, and make up their concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Jews, in the ninth of the <hi>Romans; But as it were by the works of the Law?</hi> Together with thy help, O Chriſt, we look for a bleſsing, and for heaven, and for what we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31, 32.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:33568:145"/>
               <p>Now for want of Preaching of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> Free-grace teaches a man for to deny himſelf, and to give God, in Chriſt, the preeminence alone, and to ſay, <hi>it is no more I,</hi> but the Lord is my <hi>light,</hi> and my <hi>life,</hi> and my <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and in this will I be confident; and this Free-grace cauſeth to grow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, 3, 5.</p>
               <p>Now he that hath taſted of the ſweetneſs of Free-grace, cannot but ſpeak of it, becauſe it is the onely means for to break a hard heart, and the onely cordial for to comfort a ſick ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1, 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13, 14. Now on the other ſide, he that hath not taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Free-grace, but ſpeaks of it by hear-ſay,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> though he be never ſo learned a man, yet he will be but a fumbler in ſpeaking of Free-grace, or a bungler, as we uſe for to ſpeak. And to deal plainly, I conceive, that the moſt of our Miniſters,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> want both will and skill for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33568:146"/>to ſpeak of the Free-grace of God, in and through Chriſt, for they ſpeak but little of it; and that is the reaſon, that the moſt people are ſo ignorant of it, and live ſo much in ſin, read <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. When grace doth appear, ſin vaniſhes away, <hi>O the glorious truths of grace, that lye under that black cloud of Antinomianiſm!</hi> That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful name, which cauſeth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for to ſin, in ſpeaking evil of that which they know not.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall reflect back,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> Now Jeſus Chriſt doth acquaint the ſoul, that it ſhall have the evidences of his Spirit, for to comfort it in time of diſtreſs, when temptation doth come upon it, and when the world doth trouble it, and when worldly men do oppoſe it; and if it doth begin to ſink or to droup,

                  <hi>Peter, help Lord;</hi> ſend the evidences of thy Spirit to acquaint me of <hi>the ſure mercies of David;</hi> and thus the ſoul doth acquaint Chriſt with its wants; and then the ſoul doth find <hi>the left hand of Chriſt to be under its head,</hi> when it is in communion with Chriſt in the <hi>banqueting houſe,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> which houſe is Chriſt himſelf; and there <hi>the right hand of Chriſt doth imbrance me,</hi> ſaith the ſoul: [Now theſe embraces, that Chriſt gives the ſoul, they are the ſweet gayls of the Spirit, which put all things out of doubt in the ſoul,] <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Now it pleaſeth Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Chriſt like a mother draws a curtain.</note> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to draw a curtain between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the ſoul, as a mother doth ſometimes in love to her child, and then the child cries after her; and thus the poor ſoul cries after the Spirit of Chriſt, in all occaſions, to come and comfort it: <hi>Make haſt my beloved,</hi> ſaith the ſoul to Chriſt, <hi>and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains of ſpices: Flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, make haste,</hi> do not ſtay by the way, ſaith the ſoul that longs after Chriſt: No comfort like unto thine, O

<note place="margin">Want of humane learning is no let in revealing Chriſt.</note> Now I had rather hear ſuch mechanick men one hour, then ſome great learned men twenty four hours, though they ſhould come from <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridg:</hi> In caſe they ſhould be but only learned in the brain, and ſo learned in the theorick, that is, to ſpeak of an outſide, and no more.</p>
               <p>Now I will give you a reaſon of what I have ſaid. A learned man having the School-Arts, may by the help of a Globe, or a Map,

Now ſuch men can
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:33568:156"/>ſpeak the trueſt of that place,

And they know his name, and therefore <hi>they truſt in his name, and ſpeak good of it, Pſal.</hi> 9.10. Therefore it is more profitable to hear ſuch mechanick men, or ſuch illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate men, though it may be they are jeered with the ſpirit; and what they do, ſay ſome, they do it by the ſpirit: and this is ſpoken by way of a jeer. But I will tell you what I think, That God doth ſee this as great a ſin in <hi>England,</hi> as any one ſin. And this is that ſpirit of Antichriſt, which denies Chriſt come in the fleſh, or in our fleſh, as you may read 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. The Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt come in the fleſh, but they muſt not confeſs him to be come into their fleſh, for to guide and to lead them, and teach them; but they muſt be taught by their great <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Rabbies</hi> of their Church, and they muſt be led which way they will: and is it not even ſo amongſt us at this day? As for inſtance, in our Clergy men of

The one party for the King, ſtrives for that eaſie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Service Book, or Common Prayer Book, and their own Will-worſhip, with their old ceremonies, which are as a ſhadow, or a vail before their eyes, ſo that they cannot ſee the Subſtance of Religion, but dote after the ſhadow: And the other party, which is for the Parliament, they ſtrive for a <hi>Directory</hi> after the beſt <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and the neereſt to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as they ſay; but they themſelves will be the Judges over other mens Conſciences,

               <p>NOw I ſhall crave leave for to whiſper a word or two in the ear of thoſe that are Miniſters of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book, or ſome others that can Preach, yet are like unto them. My two words are theſe:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> There are three ſorts of Miniſters;</p>
               <p>The firſt is,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Miniſters of Chriſt, and thoſe that he doth ſend, are <hi>lively,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:33568:194"/>ſpiritual, and ſoul-comforting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſecond ſort,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Now theſe two ſorts are true Miniſters of God.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a third ſort of Miniſters, which lyes between the true Miniſters and the Magiſtrate;</p>
               <p>And theſe men are imitating Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, like unto thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, in the firſt of the <hi>Philippians. Some,</hi> ſaith he, read <hi>Chriſt, even out of envy; and ſome,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>preach Chriſt out of envy and ſtrife,</hi> and out of oſtentation, and for the applauſe of men,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> or elſe, they would not take that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the ſimple people, as they do; for when they have ſpoken a word that doth tickle their brain, then the moſt of the people cry, [a hum,] and ſay, O he is a brave Schollar: And thus they read, and preach in a plauſible way, and in an hiſtorical way, full of <hi>legality,</hi>


                  <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Now I know that ſome will object and ſay, That knowledg comes by reading; but it ſeems, that I would deny the uſe of ſuch means, as the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Service Book.</p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:33568:195"/>

               <p>But you will object and ſay,


<label type="milestone">

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> It is fit that they ſhould come; and it is fit, that ſuch as cannot read, ſhould not be ſo ſlightly put off; as with bare reading of the Word, but with reading and expounding, and inſtructing out of the Word of God; as <hi>Philip</hi> did to the <hi>Eunuch, Act.</hi> 8.35. It is well if the Book be not ſealed, ſo that they cannot expound nor preach Jeſus to the people. If it ſhould be ſo, then I ſhall give my ſecond anſwer,</p>
               <p>That ſuch men or Miniſters as theſe,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> are like unto a man that comes to a Market, and brings a box full of very precious commodities; and when the

               <p>Now by this Box, I mean, the Scriptures, the Word of God, which is full of the precious graces of Jeſus Chriſt: But ſuch men as I have ſpoken of, have no key to open this Box; they cannot break the <hi>bread of life</hi> to the hungry people; they cannot do ſo much as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did, for ſhe brake the <hi>Box of precious oyntment, and poured it on Chriſts head, Mark</hi> 14.3.</p>
               <p>Now the bare Letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is as a Box, and we have many men in this Kingdom, that have got this Box, and no more. I mean,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> the Letter of the Word, which being drawn out into a form of the Common-Prayer Book; Theſe men are excellent outſide men, they can read the Letter of the Word, with a humane courage,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☜"/> but they cannot give the ſenſe of the Pearl in this Box, or Cabinet, or Field: They cannot expound the <hi>unſearchable rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:33568:196"/>for want of this, in many places of this Kingdom, the people are like the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, ignorantly worſhiping God,</hi> or more groſly and ſuperſtitiouſly, <hi>ſetting up Altars to the unknown God, Acts</hi> 17.22, 23. Yet theſe people have had the Service Book all their days, and they will have it ſtill, and remain ignorant with it; and ſo the proverb holds true, <hi>Like Prieſt, like people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But mark you dark-ſighted Miniſters,


<label type="milestone">

                  <hi>My people have been loſt ſheep,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>their ſhepherds have cauſed them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,

A Miniſter to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the Goſpel of Grace, begets ignorance in a people; ignorance in a people makes them unſtedfaſt. Now ſuch a people will ſooner fight againſt the Truth, and ſpeak againſt the Truth, then they will entertain the Truth, or ſpeak a good word for the Truth.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> Happy is ſuch a people that have an able Miniſter <hi>of the New Teſtament,
<note place="margin">A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſent from the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> is the moſt excellent <hi>Minister.</hi>
                     </note> not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> for ſuch a miniſtry, or ſuch a Miniſter is the moſt excellent Miniſter, for he cares for the ſouls of men, and would <hi>be ſpent for them; and the more he loves

Now the reading Miniſter onely of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book, and the [imitating] preaching Miniſter, that preaches litter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, legally, hiſtorically, and artificially; Theſe two are both alike, and they both ſeek themſelves: But it may be ſome will take exception at this word [imitating.]</p>
               <p>But I ſhall give you two inſtances for it, One in the Old Teſtament,
<note place="margin">Two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> and another in the New: The falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Baal</hi> did imitate, to do as the true Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> did; they could chuſe one Bullock for a ſacrifice, and <hi>cut it in peices, and lay the wood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lay the Bullock upon the Altar;</hi> but they wanted fire from Heaven, <hi>they had no light in them,</hi>

               <p>The ſecond inſtance is out of the New Teſtament. Some indeed imitate to do as the true Apoſtles did, but they cannot; ſo then they <hi>preach Chriſt out of envy, and ſome out of ſtrife, Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two ſorts of Miniſters
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33568:197"/>are ſelf-ſeeking men,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="☞"/> as I ſhall give you inſtances, both from City and Country, and from Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now theſe ſelf-ſeeking men,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="NOTE."/> ſeek great Benefices of ſix or ſeven hundred pounds a yeer, and then they will take the Charge, and the Cure of twenty or thirty thouſand ſouls, as you may take an inſtance in <hi>Cripplegate</hi> Pariſh,

                  <hi>London:</hi> And ſo likewiſe, in divers places of the Country, where there are great Benefices; and their Miniſter takes this, but the poor people have little or nothing but the Book of Common-Prayer, or the reading of a Homily, or the like. And thus they cure themſelves, and take the charge of the people, but the poor people are ſtill uncured.
